InterHavoc - Our group game

Hey Dr Raffe & Ms Shen. I attempted to follow the git instructions to the letter,
but couldn't make this a private repository (this is restricted to paid accounts).

We bundled our files into the repository, but here is a read only link to the report
on google drive, just in case;

Here is the presentation too;

As an aside, we kind of struggled to get some proper shared work done due to some
communication issues and struggles with github + bitbucket + source tree. Apologies
for this. We're getting back up to speed, and are looking forward to working on
the meat of the project and polishing it for the final submission.
